      Hi, I'm Will Kujala. 
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. My research and teaching interests are at the boundary between political theory and international relations. My central research questions concern the intellectual history of empire and anticolonialism, internationalism, and the philosophy of social science. All of these interests are more or less bounded by a fascination about their concatenation in the 1960s.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      My PhD dissertation examines how antiracist internationalists linked criticisms of US empire and criticisms of police brutality in the 1960s.

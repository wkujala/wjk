    <b>Winter 2021: POL S 469, Ethics in International Relations</b>: 
    <p>
    This seminar examines major ethical debates within the study and practice of international relations. What specific ethical problems arise from the fact that we live in a world simultaneously 'united' and 'divided' into sovereign states? We discuss the role of normative theory in IR, ethical quandaries deepened by 'globalization,' and a series of ethical issues concerning war, borders, poverty/inequality, and climate change.

    <b>Summer 2020: POL S 404, Violence and the Idea of Progress</b>: 
</p>
<p>This course examines the emergence and political effects of the concept of progress, with an eye to the question of how theorists of historical progress dealt with the problem of violence. If the historical record is populated by a plenitude of senseless violence, how can it be read in terms of progress toward greater rationality and freedom? Alongside the conceptualization of this problem by thinkers such as Kant, Hegel, and Marx, we examine twentieth-century debates about progress through writers such as CLR James, Hannah Arendt, Sri Aurobindo, Theodor Adorno, and Frantz Fanon.

    <b>Spring 2019: POL S 211, History of Political Theory</b>
</p>
<p>This class was an introduction to the history of Western political philosophy from Plato to Marx. Our general arc in the course was to highlight the tension between the two terms ‘politics’ and ‘philosophy,’ and the attempts by political theorists to reconcile that tension. What about politics resists our attempts to solve problems through philosophy? Why should we do ‘theory’ about politics, and how can it help us in the study of political science more generally? We highlight central concepts as places where this tension is heightened or reduced, such as justice, sovereignty, equality, and liberty.

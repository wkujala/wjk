    PhD Project
</h2>
<p>
    My PhD project examines the intellectual history of antiracist and anticolonial internationalism in the 1960s. More specifically, it asks how thinkers such as James and Grace Lee Boggs, Malcolm X, Claudia Jones, Robert F. Williams, and others linked US empire and state violence in the US. In my view, these critics and Black liberation thinkers are indispensable for reflections on the durability of empire and colonialism in world politics. I argue that a key thesis running through their work is that the moment of decolonization was also, crucially, a moment of <i>domestication</i>, where decolonization as the spread of the nation-state across the globe abetted the US state's attempts to limit Black and Indigenous resistance to a 'domestic' issue. In addition to this, I argue that these thinkers embody the practice of thinking dialectically, and that to learn what it means to think dialectically we should not (only) return to Hegel and Marx, but witness the workings of dialectical critique in practice.

    Other Research Interests
</h2>
<p>
    I am also interested in writing, talking, and thinking about the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Empire, race, and colonialism in International Relations, especially through the lens of anticolonial thinkers such as Aime Cesaire, Frantz Fanon, Kwame Nkrumah, Amilcar Cabral, and W.E.B. Du Bois</li>
        <li>Philosophy of history, historiography, and method in intellectual history</li>
        <li>Early modern political thought, especially Hobbes and Spinoza's theories of sovereignty and authority, and their implications today</li>
        <li>Twentieth century political thought more generally, especially concerning problems of exceptional political violence -- in Ira Katznelson's words, total war and totalitarianism.</li>
    </ul>
